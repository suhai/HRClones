#+TITLE: Environment Setup

This document outlines what tools we'll be using during the class to complete
exercises. It is recommended that you at least read the /Prerequisites/ section
below before the start of class.

* Prerequisites

** Download Google Chrome

All demos and lecture content will be conducted from within [[https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/][Google Chrome]]: it is
recommended that you download and install Chrome prior to class.

All examples will be conducted from within Chrome -- this is important because
each browser's /console/ is different in:

+ Appearance
+ Function
+ Keystrokes to open

If you are using Chrome, the demos and help that we give will be more relevant
and familiar.

** Learn to Open the Console

It is recommended that you memorize how to open a console with the appropriate
keyboard shortcut. We'll open and close the console frequently.

* Working with the Console

The *console* is a development tool that is used to quickly evaluate JavaScript
code and debug programs (at least this is how we will be using it -- there are
other uses too!). A console can be opened in /all/ web pages. Each browser has
its own console, and they all behave slightly differently. You can read more
about Chrome's console [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-ui?hl=en][here]].

** Entering Code

Code can be entered directly into the console:

** Cycling History

You can use the *up/down arrow keys* on your keyboard to cycle through the
console's history:

** Expansion (Objects & Arrays)

(*NOTE:* Objects and arrays will be covered in lecture -- if you don't know what
these are, don't worry about this yet)

Arrays and objects can be expanded and viewed:

* Working in [[http://codepen.io][Codepen]]

*Codepen* is an online tool that can be used to write JavaScript, HTML and CSS
right from inside of your browser. No files, text editors or knowledge of how to
set up a working development environment is required. We'll be using Codepen for
all of our exercises and the project. You can read more about Codepen [[http://codepen.io/about/][here]].

** Layout

The default layout isn't great, but it can be changed!

** Console

Fortunately, functions and variables defined in codepen can be accessed
from the console.

** Errors

Errors happen. Codepen will show a little red exclamation point in the lower
right that can be clicked to help troubleshoot the error.
