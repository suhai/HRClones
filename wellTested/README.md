> A simple, well-tested todo app

## Initial setup

Install the `grunt-cli` module globally:

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```


## Running the tests

To build and run tests once:

```

To build, then watch for changes and run tests accordingly:

```shell
grunt
```


# Software Used

## [Jasmine]

Jasmine is used for client-side unit testing.

## [Karma]

Karma is used to run unit tests client-side in real browsers.

The following Karma plugins are used:

* [karma-coverage] - Build coverage reports with Istanbul
* [karma-jasmine] - Allow unit tests to be written with Jasmine
* [karma-chrome-launcher] - Launch Chrome for testing
* [karma-firefox-launcher] - Launch Firefox for testing

## [Istanbul]

Istanbul generates code coverage reports for client-side unit tests.

## [CasperJS]

CasperJS is used to run client-side end-to-end tests in a headless browser.

## [PhantomCSS]

PhantomCSS is used to run visual regression tests in a headless browser.

## [Grunt]

Grunt is used to perform build tasks and kick of testing operations, as well as watch files for changes and test accordingly.

The following Grunt plugins are used:

* [grunt-karma] - Start Karma from Grunt
* [grunt-casperjs] - Start CasperJS from Grunt
* [grunt-phantomcss] - Start PhantomCSS from Grunt
* [grunt-express-server] - Start a server for CasperJS and PhantomCSS testing
* [grunt-contrib-jshint] - Check for JavaScript errors before running tests
* [grunt-contrib-watch] - Watch files for changes and run tasks accordingly
* [grunt-karma-coveralls] - Submit code coverage reports to Coveralls


# Services Used

## [TravisCI]

TravisCI is used to run tests when commits are pushed or pull requests are submitted.

See [GUI & Headless browser testing with Travis](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/) for information on setting up Travis for headless testing.

## [Coveralls]

Coveralls is used to track code coverage over time. After tests run on TravisCI, the code coverage report is submitted to Coveralls.
